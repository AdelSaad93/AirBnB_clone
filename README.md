# AirBnB Clone

## Description

### How to Start
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

- `help`: Display available commands.
- `quit`: Exit the command interpreter.
- `create <class_name>`: Create a new instance of the specified class.
- `show <class_name> <id>`: Display information about a specific instance.
- `destroy <class_name> <id>`: Delete a specific instance.
